# PadTaniML

Hello! This is Deeplearning model tensorflow for nitrogen and disease classification.

So what we do in this project?

1. Exploring Dataset with Kaggle

   Reference for the dataset we used:
   - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gutierrezsoares/rice-leafs-500px
   - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adefiqri12/riceleafsv3

2. Dividing Dataset into Training, Validation, and Testing

   We are using composition about 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for Testing.

3. Classify MANUALLY with human eye ability to divide the healthy dataset into 3 class of interval based on LCC (BWD)

4. Create Deep Learning model using TensorFlow for both dataset

5. Training the model until reached the peak/callbacks

6. Saved the model and convert it into quantized tflite format

7. Deploy the model to App with Mobile Development
